Here's how to build your code using "make":
1) Choose the language you want (C++, Java, Python, or C#).
2) Find the "MakefileX" and "runX" where X is your language you wish to code in and remove the X part of the string
3) Now when you make it should make for the correct language you will be coding in!
4) Modify the basic code we in the language you chose gave you to make the best AI possible!
